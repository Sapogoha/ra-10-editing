# Editing

## Redux

This is a list of services with their prices. You can edit, delete or add items on the list.
This app does not use any backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project I use [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### In order to check the project, you can run
